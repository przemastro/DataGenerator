# DataGenerator
Python + QT4

This is a demo version of an application I used to generate and load test data to SQL Server database. It is prepared for 
https://github.com/przemastro/TestsingTraining-Polish-.git application but obviously can be addapted to any application which uses rest api.
It consists of following:

Python modules

    Main - connect to DB and load/dete data or create db structure
    Gui - QT4 module to create desktop app and connect with Main module
